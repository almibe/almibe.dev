I've spent the past couple of days working switching my focus back to Ligature.
I'm focusing on the Scala implementation for the backend using ZeroMQ to communicate with frontends.
Doing a bunch of clean-up and small tasks right now mostly around how Ligature interfaces with Wander,
some small Wander changes, Wander's REPL, and Ligature Lab which is one of the front end for working with Wander and Ligature.
