Spent the past couple of days polishing up Sisal and doing some work on Wander like getting a basic module system working.
Today however I started on a new project that involves generating F# code from Wander.
The main idea is that I'll be able to implement more things in Wander be able to share the code across both the Rust and F# versions.
I'm just starting on this but I've alrady made some basic progress mainly due to the awesome err fabulous https://github.com/edgarfgp/Fabulous.AST.
I'll probably be working on this for the next couple of days or perhaps until the end of the month.
