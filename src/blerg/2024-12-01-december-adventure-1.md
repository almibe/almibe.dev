My second December Adventure.
This year I have a goal of getting started with game boy homebrew programming.
I don't really have a final goal outside of getting a workflow setup for doing game boy development.
Along with this I plan on doing improvements on my websites and continuing my recent projects.

Here are some of the resources I've been looking at so far.
