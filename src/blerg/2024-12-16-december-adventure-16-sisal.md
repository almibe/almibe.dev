I've been spending the first two weeks of December working on some tedious parts of Ligature's implementation, but I'm back a spot where I can do work that's a little more interesting.

I'm going to start back on my 11ty plugin that integrates Ligature.
In particular, I'm going to start experimenting with using Ligature to describe tags in 11ty.
The way I'm imagining this working now is that you will be able to encode relationships like a tag being equivalent or a sub-tag of another tag and that will be expressed when you are building your site.
Eventually you'll be able to express more complex relationships like mutual exclusion, but for now I'm going to keep it minimal.

As far as game boy stuff goes, I'm in the process of finding an emulator to hack on to help me learn more about the system.
[rboy](https://github.com/mvdnes/rboy) looks like a promising option.
