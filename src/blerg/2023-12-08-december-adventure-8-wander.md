Scala.js is kind of annoying me, so I'm see how much work it would be to get my previous work in F# updated.
I have stuff building and output JS using [Fable](https://fable.io), so we'll see how far I can get stuff in a day or two.
See https://github.com/almibe/ligature-fs/tree/main/src/Wander for the code I'm talking about.
