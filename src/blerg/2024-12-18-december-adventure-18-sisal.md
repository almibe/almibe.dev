Made a lot of progress on Sisal today.
I removed my ealier code which mainly focused on trying to use Wander in templates.
In its place I now have support for running Wander code to provide global data and I've added support for running Wander examples in markdown.
Not exactly sure how many other places I'll try to intregrate Ligature into 11ty, but I'm getting close to doing another release and writing some tutorials.
