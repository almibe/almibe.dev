Today I picked [https://gbdk-2020.github.io/gbdk-2020/] as the game boy sdk to start playing around with.
It is really easy to use and I was able to make a simple "Hello, Fedi!" program.

Tomorrow I plan on starting to dig into the details of programming for the game boy some more.
I'm very happy that I was able to get a development environemnt working this easily.
