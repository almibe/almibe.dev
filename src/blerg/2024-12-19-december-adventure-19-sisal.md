Today I started work on another Sisal related project.
This was to create an npx script that will handle all the 11ty config for you.
This lets you render a site with just a wander file and a template.
See [here](https://github.com/almibe/sisal/tree/main/demo) for a demo with the output.
I still have some clean up to do and documentation to write, but I should get to that in the coming days.
