I didn't do a much coding today, but what time I did get to play around was spent working on building some support applications for developing Wander with F#.
And the majority of that was spent getting caught up on AvaloniaUI.
I'm using Avalonia to make a simple UI for running and testing Wander out.
It's very minimal, for doing actual work with Wander expect a more robust application written in Tauri or a VSCode plugin at some point.
