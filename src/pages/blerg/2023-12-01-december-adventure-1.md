# December Adventure Day 1

I saw a couple of people mentioning this on fedi and decided to give it a go.
I'm mostly going to be working on two closely related libre software projects and also would like to spend some time fixing up my websites.
One of these projects, Wander, is a programming language so I'll be writing some code in that language as well as working on it directly.
The other project is a knowledge graph/semantic network project I've been working on called [Ligature](https://ligature.dev) that uses Wander as its user interface.
Other than that I mainly write Scala, Rust, F#, and TypeScript.

This adventure begins with this post!
My website doesn't have a blog section right now.
I'm using [astro](https://astro.build) for this site and have another website made with astro that has a blog section that works well, so I'll mainly be copying over that.

Done.

Okay this blog is live now.
